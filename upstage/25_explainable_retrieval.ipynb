The color of the sky is primarily due to the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere, a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. However, the context is indirectly related to the query because it mentions sunlight, which is a component of the broader topic of light and its interaction with matter. This context might help answer the query by prompting the user to think about the relationship between light and the atmosphere, leading to a discussion about Rayleigh scattering and the blue color of the sky.\n",
