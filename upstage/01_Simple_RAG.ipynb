The term \\n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \\nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past cent ury, human \\nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \\ncontributed to climate change.  \\nHistorical Context  \\nThe Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \\nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \\n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and  human civilization. \\nMost of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\\'s orbit that \\nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which', 'driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  \\nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  \\nGreenhouse Gases  \\nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \\natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \\noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is  essential \\nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \\nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.  \\nFossil Fuels  \\nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \\nnatural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \\nthe beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \\ntoday.  \\nCoal']\n",
